## LÖVE Experiments
This repository will house some experiments I do in the LÖVE framework. There will be three folders: CTR (3DS), HAC (Switch), and PC. 3DS and Switch will have their own resolutions and require the nëst library to function. Furthemore, (some of) the console examples will need to be ran on the device hardware, depending on what it is.
