## LÖVE Experiments

This repository will house some experiments I do in the LÖVE framework. Each one is housed inside its respective module folder. The folders labeled `_ctr` and `_hac` within a module represent testing specific for Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch. This may require use of the physical hardware, depending on the example. Otherwise, you can use the nëst library.
